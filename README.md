CREALITY THEME FOR MAINSAIL.

Made by moi for those of us who like our Klipper but don't want to shell out for a Sonic Pad.
At least you can rep your printer brand a little more from the Mainsail page.

Create a folder under Machine named .theme then put all files in this folder but FIRST!!!!...Don't forget to click settings under Machine and check the Hidden Files box.
