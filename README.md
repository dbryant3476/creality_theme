CREALITY THEME FOR MAINSAIL.

Made by moi for those of us who like our Klipper but don't want to shell out for a Sonic Pad.
At least you can rep your printer brand a little more from the Mainsail page.

Create a folder under Machine named .theme then hop over to your pi via ssh and put all files in this folder (as we all know folders that start with . are invisible and won't show on the web interface)

Don't forget to click settings under Machine and activate invisible folders
